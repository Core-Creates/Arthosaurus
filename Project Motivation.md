# Project Motivation
Over the past century, there have been remarkable improvements in medicine and technology that have been used to better treat, diagnose, monitor and improve the quality of life for humans. Due to this there has been a continual increase in life expectancy over the past century. Unfortunately, as our population achieves greater longevity, we notice a proportionate increase in health related burdens that inclines our impaired to depend on healthcare facilities; subsequently introducing higher medical care related costs, reduced independence, and overall reduced quality of life. Our solution seeks to address these concerns for individuals by offering a low-cost, easily accessible tool that interacts with people through voice. Through this method of modality, our application can support any individual with mobility or vision impairments using an affordable smart device that leverages a free speech-to-text embedded program to continuously monitor and respond to a person's queries and needs. Further, this methodology allows for remote assistance and remote healthcare monitoring so that individuals can continue to live their lives at home rather than in nursing homes or hospitals. Through this application, we wish to uphold our belief that independence shouldnâ€™t be forfeit even if one bears an impairment.
